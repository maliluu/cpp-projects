The domain chosen is a Pet Shop Management System.
The system will manage customer check-ins, pet grooming appointments, and pet food inventory.

★ Activity 1: Customer check-in system,
The data structure used is a queue.
Customers arrive at the pet shop and are added to a queue based on their arrival time.
The check-in system processes customers based on who arrives first, and when the customers check in, they are removed from the queue.
The class that will be used in the algorithm is a PetShopQueue class.

★ Activity 2: Pet Grooming Appointment Scheduling,
The data structure used is a list.
The appointments will be ordered by schedule time, and stored in a list, that allows:
  Adding new appointments,
  Modifying existing ones,
  Cancelling appointments.
We will use a sorting algorithm to keep the appointments ordered by time so that the earliest is processed first.
The class that will be used is a GroomingAppointment class.

★ Activity 3: Pet Food Inventory Management,
The data structure used is a map.
Each set in the map will contain the PetFood name as the key and the Stock as the value.
The map will allow:
  Adding new food items,
  Updating stock quantities,
  Searching for specific pet foods.
The class that will be used is a PetFood class.
