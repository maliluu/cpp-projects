/*
    â˜… Activity 2: Pet Grooming Appointment Scheduling,
        The data structure used is a list.
        The appointments will be:
            ordered by schedule time,
            and stored in a list,
            that allows adding new appointments,
            modifying existing ones,
            and cancelling appointments.
        We will use a sorting algorithm to keep the appointments ordered by time so that the earliest is processed first.
        The class that will be used is a GroomingAppointment class.
