/*  
    â˜… Activity 1: Customer check-in system,
        The data structure used is a queue. 
        Customers arrive at the pet shop and are added to a queue based on their arrival time. 
        The check-in system processes customers based on who arrives first,
        and when the customers check in, they are removed from the queue.
        The class that will be used in the algorithm is a Customer class.
